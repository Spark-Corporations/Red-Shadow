# Exploitation Skill

## Objective
Exploit confirmed vulnerabilities to demonstrate impact. REQUIRES HUMAN APPROVAL.

## Safety Rules
- **ALWAYS** require operator approval before exploitation
- NEVER use destructive payloads without explicit authorization
- Prefer least-invasive exploitation paths
- Log every exploitation attempt with full detail

## Workflow
1. Prioritize vulnerabilities by severity (critical → high → medium)
2. Select appropriate exploit module (Metasploit, SQLMap, Hydra, custom)
3. Configure payload with minimal footprint
4. Request operator approval
5. Execute and document results

## Tools
- **metasploit**: Module-based exploitation, meterpreter sessions
- **sqlmap**: SQL injection exploitation
- **hydra**: Credential brute-forcing
- **custom_exploit**: Python/Bash exploit scripts
