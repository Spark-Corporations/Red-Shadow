# Exploit Skill — RedClaw v2.0

## ⚠️ REQUIRES HUMAN APPROVAL

This skill attempts active exploitation. Every exploit execution requires
explicit user confirmation before proceeding.

## Overview
Execute exploitation against discovered vulnerabilities using Metasploit,
SQLMap, or custom exploit scripts.

## Workflow

1. **Vulnerability Verification**
   - Confirm the vulnerability exists (re-scan if needed)
   - Check exploit availability in Metasploit DB
   - Assess risk level and potential impact

2. **Exploit Selection**
   - Match vulnerability to available exploits
   - Select appropriate payload (reverse shell, meterpreter, etc.)
   - Configure LHOST, LPORT, and target parameters

3. **Execution** (AFTER APPROVAL)
   - Launch exploit via Metasploit/SQLMap/custom script
   - Monitor for successful exploitation
   - Capture evidence (screenshots, session info)

4. **Post-Exploitation Bridge**
   - If successful, transition to post-exploitation phase
   - Run initial enumeration (whoami, id, network info)
   - Document access level achieved

## Exploitation Frameworks

| Framework | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| Metasploit | Known CVEs, service exploits, payload delivery |
| SQLMap | SQL injection (GET/POST/Cookie injection points) |
| Custom Scripts | PoC exploits, Python/Bash scripts |

## Example Usage
```
/exploit CVE-2021-44228
/exploit "SMB EternalBlue on 10.10.10.5:445"
/exploit "SQL injection on http://target/login.php"
```

## Safety
- GuardianRails blocks destructive payloads
- Each exploit requires human confirmation
- All actions are audit-logged
