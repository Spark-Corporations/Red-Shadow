⚠️ EXPLOITATION PHASE — This requires explicit human approval.

Target: $ARGUMENTS

## Before proceeding:
1. Confirm the target is within scope
2. List the vulnerabilities discovered during scanning
3. Propose specific exploits with expected impact
4. **Wait for explicit user approval** before executing any exploit

## Available exploitation tools:
- **Metasploit** (redclaw-msf) — Full exploitation framework
- **SQLMap** (redclaw-sqlmap) — SQL injection exploitation
- **Custom Exploits** (redclaw-custom) — Python/Bash exploit scripts

## Safety Rules:
- NEVER exploit without explicit user confirmation
- Log all exploitation attempts with timestamps
- Document evidence for each successful exploit
- Stop immediately if GuardianRails blocks the action

Ask the user which vulnerability to exploit and wait for approval.
